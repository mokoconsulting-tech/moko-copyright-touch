/*
 * Description:
 *   Copy this file to "moko-copyright-touch.params.json" at your project root,
 *   then fill in the fields below. Any missing values are resolved in this order:
 *   CLI > project params > script defaults > prompt.
 *
 *   All string values should be JSON-encoded. Paths are relative to this file unless specified otherwise.
 *   Use forward slashes for portability (e.g., "./output" or "../shared/templates").
 *   For Windows compatibility, you may also use double backslashes in JSON strings (e.g., "..\\shared\\templates").
 *   Encode newlines as \\n within strings if needed.
 *
 * Key fields:
 *   StartIn                Relative path to the project root (required).
 *   Destination            If empty, files are modified in place; otherwise, relative destination folder for outputs.
 *   Holder / Email / Phone Your contact info used in generated headers.
 *   Years                  Year or range; leave empty to use the current year.
 *   License                SPDX identifier (e.g., GPL-3.0-or-later).
 *   DefGroup               Doxygen group name for @defgroup (default: Dolibarr).
 *   InGroup                Doxygen @ingroup tag value.
 *   Brief / Description    Short/long texts used by header templates.
 *   wordwrap               Soft wrap width for header text (default: 80).
 *   IncludeSubdirectories  Recursively scan subfolders.
 *   FileTypes              File extensions to process.
 *   IgnorePatterns         Glob-like paths to skip.
 *   IncludePatterns        Optional allow-list; processed before IgnorePatterns.
 *   HeaderTemplateFile     Relative path to the header template JSON.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   If StartIn is empty, script must abort with an error.
 *   If Destination is empty, overwrite mode is assumed.
 *   FileTypes array must contain at least one extension, otherwise script exits.
 *   IgnorePatterns and IncludePatterns are applied in order, IncludePatterns first.
 *   Relative paths are resolved based on the location of the project params file.
 *   Newline escapes (\\n) in Brief and Description are converted to real line breaks at runtime.
 *   On Windows, ensure backslashes are escaped in JSON ("C:\\Projects\\Example").
