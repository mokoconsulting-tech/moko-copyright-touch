 * Description:
 * moko-copyright-touch.headertemplates.template.json
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file defines the per-extension copyright header templates used by
 * moko-copyright-touch.ps1. It must be present in the same directory as the
 * script or in a project root for custom overrides.
 *
 * File Naming Requirement:
 *   - The filename must be exactly "moko-copyright-touch.headertemplates.json".
 *   - Custom project-specific versions must retain this exact name to be detected.
 *
 * What to do with this file:
 *   - Modify or add extension keys to match your project's file types.
 *   - Adjust the comment style and content array for each extension group.
 *   - Ensure placeholders match those supported by the script.
 *   - Keep a backup of any customized version for reuse across projects.
 *
 * • Each key is a comma-delimited list of file extensions that share the same
 *   comment style and header content.
 * • Header content is a JSON array of lines which may include placeholders
 *   and will be wrapped using the defined comment syntax.
 * • Tab characters and sizes can optionally be defined per extension group.
 *
 * Placeholders:
 *   {{Years}}, {{Holder}}, {{Email}}, {{Phone}}, {{License}}, {{DefGroup}},
 *   {{Brief}}, {{FileName}}, {{InGroup}}, {{Description}}, {{AdditionalInfo}}
 *
 * Special TAB placeholders in content lines:
 *   {{TAB}}  -> one indentation unit (tab_char or tab_size spaces)
 *   {{TAB2}} -> two indentation units
 *   {{TAB4}} -> four indentation units
 *
