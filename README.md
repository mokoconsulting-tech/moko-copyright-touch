# moko-copyright-touch - README.md

**moko-copyright-touch** is a lightweight, configurable script that automatically applies or updates standardized, **Doxygen-compatible** copyright headers to source files.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* **Automatic header insertion and update**
  Detects existing headers in a known format and updates them; otherwise inserts a new one.

* **JSON-based defaults**
  Loads parameters from `moko-copyright-touch.params.json` in the project root (or script folder if missing).

* **Parameter fallbacks**
  Project parameters override script defaults; CLI overrides both.

* **Interactive prompting**
  Prompts for missing parameters and writes them to the params file.

* **Flexible configuration**
  Supports multiple programming languages with proper comment styles. Default `@defgroup` is `dolibarr` unless overridden.

* **Header templates**
  Use `headertemplate` JSON files to define reusable headers for one or multiple file types. Supports grouped targets via comma-separated keys or `apply_to` arrays. Falls back to the `php` template if no match is found.

* **Shortcut-friendly**
  `startin` can be set for running from shortcuts.

* **Self-healing defaults**
  If no params file is found, one is created with supplied or prompted defaults.
